## Requirements

See [Tauri's prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/) for platform-specific requirements.

## Corepack

Project is using yarn v4. You don't need to install anything but you do need to enable corepack. Before running any other command run:

```bash
corepack enable
```

Corepack is a nodejs module that enables to use other package managers (pnpm, yarn) without the need to install them

## Start the app

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nchapman/hiro
cd hiro
git submodule update --init --recursive
yarn
yarn start
```

## Testing

```bash
yarn test:frontend
```

For backend tests you need to have `git-lfs` installed (`brew install git-lfs`). After you have cloned the repo do:

```
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

It will download a small llm that is required to run the tests.

Afterwards you can do

```
yarn test:backend
```
