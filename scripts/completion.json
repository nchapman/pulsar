Here is a simple Rust program that prints \"Hello, world!\" to the console:\n```\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n```\nTo compile and run this program, you can use the `rustc` compiler and the `rust` command. For example, to compile and run the program, you can use the following commands:\n```\nrustc main.rs\nrust main.rs\n```\nThis will compile the program and then run it, printing \"Hello, world!\" to the console.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
